    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Shenelle De Mel, a passionate software developer on a perpetual quest for knowledge in the dynamic world of technology. Every day, I eagerly embrace new terms and concepts, constantly seeking ways to enhance my skills and grow as a professional. Beyond the lines of code, I find joy in the great outdoors, with hiking and other outdoor activities serving as my sanctuary. </p>

<p>Despite my extroverted nature, I acknowledge the introspective tendencies that can be inherent to software developers, aligning with my personal philosophy. </p>

<p>I take pride in what I've accomplished so far and harbor a genuine love for the software development craft. It's not just about coding for me; I see myself as a creator of possibilities, always ready to develop software solutions that align with the visions of my clients.</p>
<p>Apart from my work life I'm someone who loves to unwind and have a good laugh with the people I love. Afterall the life we're after is a life full of Happiness, Love, Joy and Peace. The one way to lead such a life is by inner peace which one will gain by spending more time with themselves.</p>
